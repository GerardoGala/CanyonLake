  <title>Sunfish Capsize in a 15MPH Wind</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;This is my first time to sail alone and without the comfort of the Race Committee boat in a 15MPH wind. After about&amp;nbsp; my 6th time rounding the windward mark, I tried improving my tack. I was paying too much attention to how close I was to the mark and neglected other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I capsized once and I thought I'd better go in after this fearing that I might exhaust myself further should I capsize again while the wind gets heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at a race last month, I was still confident after about&amp;nbsp; 12 capsizes when the wind was at about&amp;nbsp; 20MPH. And when the wind got to about&amp;nbsp; 25MPH, I could not right my Sunfish on the last capsize. I was completely exhausted when the wind was at its peak. Sadly, the Race Committee boat had to pull my turtled Sunfish.&lt;/p&gt;
